    "# Introduction: Jupyter Notebooks, Rmarkdown & Github\n",
    "\n",
    "The course materials for this session can be accessed via https://github.com/GunzIvan28/2020-repos.git.\n",
    "<small><small><i>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment that enables users to author notebooks, which contain a complete and self-contained record of a computation. These notebooks can be shared more efficiently. The notebooks may contain:\n",
    "* Live code\n",
    "* Interactive widgets\n",
    "* Narrative text\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Jupyter\" is a loose acronym meaning Julia, Python, and R; the primary languages supported by Jupyter. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The notebook can allow a computational researcher to create reproducible documentation of their research. As Bioinformatics is datacentric, use of Jupyter Notebooks increases research transparency, hence promoting open science.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Download Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for your specific OS to your home directory\n",
    "    - Linux: `wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "    - Mac: `curl https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "2. Run:\n",
    "    - `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "    - `bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "3. Follow all the prompts: if unsure, accept defaults\n",
    "4. Close and re-open your terminal\n",
    "5. If the installation is successful, you should see a list of installed packages with\n",
    "    - `conda list`\n",
    "If the command cannot be found, you can add Anaconda bin to the path using:\n",
    "    ` export PATH=~/miniconda3/bin:$PATH`\n",
    "\n",
    "For reproducible analysis, you can [create a conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) with all the Python packages you used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    `conda create --name bioinf`\n",
    "    \n",
    "To activate the conda environment:\n",
    "    `source activate bioinf`\n",
    "\n",
    "Having set-up conda environment, you can install any package you need using pip. \n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install jupyter`\n",
    "`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`\n",
    "\n",
    "or by using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip3 install jupyter`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can quickly launch it using:\n",
    "\n",
    "`jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is made up of many cells. Each cell can contain Python code. You can execute a cell by clicking on it and pressing `Shift-Enter` or `Ctrl-Enter` (run without moving to the next line). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Further help\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about Jupyter notebooks, check [the official introduction](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb) and [some useful Jupyter Tricks](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/). \n",

    "## How to learn from this resource?\n",
    "\n",
    "Download all the notebooks from [2020-repos](https://github.com/GunzIvan28/2020-repos). The easiest way to do that is to clone the GitHub repository to your working directory using any of the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/GunzIvan28/2020-repos.git\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",

    "    \n",
    "    rm master.zip\n",
    "    \n",

    "## How to Contribute\n",
    "\n",
    "To contribute, fork the repository, make some updates and send me a pull request. \n",
